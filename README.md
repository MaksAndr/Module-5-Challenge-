Observations:

1) Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest number of measurements taken, indicating they were used more frequently in the study.


2) Mice treated with Capomulin had a significant reduction in tumor volume over time, as seen in the line plot.


3) There is a strong correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin, as evidenced by the high correlation coefficient and the linear regression model plot.
